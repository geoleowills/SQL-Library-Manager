# SQL Library Manager

The application uses Express to connect a user to a library database, they have the ability to add, delete and update the books.

The Sequelize ORM is used to make the connections and queries to the SQLite database.

I have added pagination and search features to the application. This makes it easier for the user to find data, and it feels more user friendly.

## Technologies Used:
